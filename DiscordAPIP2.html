		<h2>Get Discord.js</h2>
		<p>
			First thing's first. Before anything fun happens, we need to use node.js to
			create a package.json file and get the Discord.js library.
		</p>
		<p>
			Assuming you have node.js installed, use your command line to navigate to the directory where you'd like to store your bot's source code. 
			Enter the command below into the command line:
		</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<code id = "codeexample">
	npm init
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>Now we should install the Discord.js library. Enter this next command into your command line as well:</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<code id = "codeexample">
	npm install discord.js --save
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Easy enough, right? If you take a look at your package.json file, you should see discord.js in the 
			dependencies object. If not, something went wrong.
