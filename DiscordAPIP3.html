		<h2>Make a Bot!</h2>
		<p>
			Before we can start programming our bot, we need to officially make an app
			for Discord so we can acquire a login token first. Thankfully, Discord makes this process easy.
			After making sure you've logged into your Discord account, visit the
			<a href = "https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me" target = "_blank">Discord apps</a>
			page. Here you should see an option to make a new app for discord.
		</p>
		<img src = "MyApps.png">
		<p>
			Go ahead and click on the New App box and fill in the necessary fields. We'll name our app "TestBot". 
			When you're ready, go ahead and click "Create App".
		</p>
		<img src = "NewApp.png">
		<p>
			Now we're one step away from creating our bot. You should have been greeted with a messsage
			letting you know your app was successfully created. Just below that, you should see an option to "Create
			a Bot User". This is exactly what we want to do, so go ahead and click this option and then confirm it's
			what you want to do.
		</p>
		<img src = "CreateBot.png">
		<p>
			Congrats! You've successfully made a Discord bot. We're nowhere near finished, though, we still need
			to program it! After creating your bot user, another greeting should let you know you succeeded. Just below 
			this, there should be an option to reveal your bot's token.
		</p>
		<img src = "token.png">
		<p>	
			Go ahead click to reveal the token, then copy it and open your editor of choice (make sure you save the changes to your app!).
			Assign the token as a string to a const like so:
		</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<pre><code id = "codeexample">
	const token = 'Mjg1NjcyNzQyNjE4MDA1NTA1.C5VnvQ.WWB9vcbser1wU37LCqtGxws49wk';
			</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>Now all of the grunt work is done, and we can finally start programming the bot.</p><br>
