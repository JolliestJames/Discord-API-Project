		<h1>How To Make a Discord Bot with Discord.js</h1>
		<p>For many gamers, Discord has become a mainstay for 
		communication with others who enjoy video games. The platform not only makes for easy voice 
		and text chat, but allows users to build servers that can host large 
		gaming communities. One of the best parts of Discord is the ability to make a
		bot that help keep a server organized, running smoothly and even be a source
		of entertainment for server members. Such a bot can be made with the help of Discord.js, 
		a node.js library that uses the Discord API to make the creation of a bot with JavaScript possible.</p>
