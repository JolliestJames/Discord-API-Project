		<h2>Coding the Bot</h2>
		<p>The real fun starts here. First we have to load the discord.js module so we can make use of the library.
		Enter the following code into your "TestBot.js" file, just below where you created the token variable:
		<div id = "code">
			<code id = "codeexample">
	const Discord = require('discord.js');
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now we can make use of the 
			<a href = "https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome" target = "_blank">Discord.js library documentation.</a>
			Our goal here is to make a bot, and bots in Discord are essentially just
			<a href = "https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client" target = "_blank">Client</a>
			objects, with access to every property and method that a normal Discord Client could use. 
			The Client object even has a property that tells us whether the Client is a bot or not.
			So, we create a new Client object:
		</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<code id = "codeexample">
	const Bot = new Discord.Client();
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Time to finally use that login token that we got from our Discord application. 
			We need to log the bot in using the the login method of the Discord.js Client class by
			passing the token to the login method as an argument like so:
		</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<pre><code id = "codeexample">
	Bot.login(token);
			</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now that we just need to run our JavaScript file and the bot will be live. 
			In your command line, make sure you're in the same directory as the "TestBot.js" file
			and then enter the following command:
		</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<pre><code id = "codeexample">
	node TestBot.js;
			</code></pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			And there you have it! Assuming no errors popped up, our bot is now live. But how
			can we tell? And how can we actually make the bot do something useful? Well, we'll work on
			that next.
