			To round things out, let's give TestBot a more fun command. Let's say that we want 
			TestBot to react with a dog emote any time someone sends a message with the word "dog" in it.
			We can do this by adding the code below to our "message" event listener:
		</p>
		<div id = "code">
			<code id = "codeexample">
	if(message.content.includes('dog') && message.author.username !== "TestBot")
	{
		message.channel.send(':dog:');
	}
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			This command is pretty simple. It will check to see if a message submitted to the 
			server contains the word "dog", and make sure that the username of the author property 
			(which is a Client object)	of the message sent isn't "TestBot". Otherwise, when TestBot
			responds with a dog emote, it will create an infinite loop where TestBot continues to
			respond to itself with more dog emotes. Assuming a user that isn't TestBot submits a 
			message with the word "dog" in it, TestBot will send a message to the same channel the 
			original message was submitted to containing a dog emote. This will work for any 
			emote that Discord has, just replace "dog" in <code>message.channel.send(':dog:');</code> 
			with cat, smile, etc.
		</p>

			Fun features like this can really personalize a Discord bot. If you use your imagination,
			you can create some really unique and funny bot commands that server members will enjoy, 
			improving their overall user experience.
